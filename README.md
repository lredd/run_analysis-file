The purpose of this project is to work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

You will be required to submit:
  
  1.a tidy data set as described below(one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.)
        a)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        b)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
        c)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        d)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
        e)Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
2.a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3.a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

What you find in this repository

.CodeBook.md: information about raw and tidy data set and elaboration made to transform them
